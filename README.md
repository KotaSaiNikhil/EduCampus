# EduCampus
EduCampus is a responsive learning website developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a minimalist frontend design as inspired by websites such as BYJU'S and other online learning websites.  This project demonstrates how a clean and interactive learning platform interface can be achieved using only core web technologies â€” no frameworks
